This is me and my groups finished project for our Backend course, the focus was only on the backend but we decided to add a frontend aswell because we had time over.
Very simple CSS.

Frontend is made with React.
On the backend we are using nodejs and expressjs.
The database we are using is MongoDB (noSQL).

Also tried using sockets for the first time.

Note that there is no github pages for this because I don't have an active server/database running.
